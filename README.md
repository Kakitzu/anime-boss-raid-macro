## Disclaimer
This macro was developed and tested on a specific PC environment (my own). It has reliance on image detection, which means it finds buttons and other elements by looking for pixel perfect matches to its stored images.
**What this means for you:** The macro was developed without user accessibility in mind and its success depends on your own PC environment.

## How to Run
1.  **Download the `.exe`:** Go to the [**Releases Page**](https://github.com/Kakitzu/Anime-Boss-Raid-Macro/releases). Download the `ABR_Macro.exe` file from the latest release.

3.  **IMPORTANT ANTIVIRUS WARNING:**
    -   Windows Defender will likely pop up a blue screen saying "Windows protected your PC".
    -   This is a **false positive**. Click **"More info"**, and then click the **"Run anyway"** button.
4.  **Configure and Run:** Select the packs you want to buy, set your hotkeys if desired, and start the macro!
